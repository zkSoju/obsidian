# The Graph

**Querying and indexing data from the blockchain is difficult.** Contract events allow external applications to read data that is difficult to query directly. 

Basic read operations are available directly to the contract through public/external functions; however, more advanced operations are necessary for complex applications (ex. aggregation, search, relationships, etc.).

For example, querying for a specific BAYC with certain characteristics or finding owned apes by an address is difficult. To fetch this data normally you would have to process each transfer event, read metadata, and aggregate it.

[Episode!]! represents array of Episode objects, since array is non-nullable array is always expect and Episode! is non nullable then each item is expected to be of type Episode
