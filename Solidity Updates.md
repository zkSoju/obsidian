## 0.8.2

Low level inliner

If code inside of function is simple enough and doesnâ€™t cause side effects, the compiler inlines the entire function and if there are no additional references to the function then the tag to the function is removed entirely

```solidity
PUSH <tag>
JUMP
...
<tag>:
[ROUTINE]
JUMP
```

```solidity
[ROUTINE]
JUMP
...
<tag>:
[ROUTINE]
JUMP
```
